This is a machine learning model that demonstrates the use of Decision Tree Algorithm. 

### The model determines weather the individual has lung cancer based on various features such as : 
* Age of the individual (AGE)
* Number of cigarettes smoked in a day (SKOKES)
* Number of alcholic drinks consumed in a day (ALCOHOL)
